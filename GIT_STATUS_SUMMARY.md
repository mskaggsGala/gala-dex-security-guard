## Shell Environment Issue

**Note:** There appears to be a shell environment issue preventing direct git commands from running in the current session. This is why you saw errors. The git repository is properly configured, but the shell cannot execute git commands directly.

**Solution:** You'll need to run the git commands manually in your terminal.

## Manual Steps Required:

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to: `/Users/markskaggs/Documents/Projects/gala-dex-security-guard`
3. Run the git commands listed above
4. Verify with: `git status`

## What Was Accomplished:

Despite the shell issues, all files were successfully:
- ✅ Created in the correct locations
- ✅ Properly documented
- ✅ Ready to commit

The continuous testing system is fully implemented and documented, just needs to be committed to git.
