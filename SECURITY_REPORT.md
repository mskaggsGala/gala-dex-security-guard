# GalaSwap DEX Security Assessment Report

**Date:** August 2024
**Tested Endpoint:** https://dex-backend-prod1.defi.gala.com
**Test Type:** Black Box Security Testing

## Executive Summary

Security testing revealed **1 CRITICAL** vulnerability and several areas for improvement. The DEX shows good resilience against most attack vectors but lacks rate limiting.

## Critical Findings

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: No Rate Limiting

**Issue:** API accepts unlimited requests without throttling
- **Test:** 100 concurrent requests completed in 345ms with 100% success
- **Impact:** Vulnerable to DoS attacks, API abuse, and resource exhaustion
- **Proof:** Successfully sent 100 requests in <0.5 seconds

**Recommendation:**
Implement rate limiting per IP and wallet:
- Per IP: 100 requests per minute
- Per wallet: 50 requests per minute  
- Global: 10000 requests per minute

## Medium Risk Findings

### ðŸŸ¡ Hex Value Input Acceptance

**Issue:** API accepts hex notation (0x1234) as valid input
- **Test:** amountIn: '0x1234' returned HTTP 200
- **Impact:** Potential for confusion or unexpected behavior
- **Recommendation:** Strictly validate decimal string inputs only

## Positive Security Findings âœ…

### 1. Sandwich Attack Protection
- **Result:** PROTECTED - Sandwich attacks yield negative profit
- **Test:** Front-run/back-run simulation showed -1034 GALA loss
- **Mechanism:** Likely using concentrated liquidity and slippage protection

### 2. Input Validation
- **Result:** STRONG - Properly rejects invalid inputs
- Rejects: Negative numbers, NaN, null, overflow values
- Blocks: SQL injection attempts, path traversal

### 3. Token Validation
- **Result:** SECURE - Invalid tokens properly rejected
- Blocks malformed token identifiers
- Prevents injection via token parameters

### 4. Concurrent Operation Handling
- **Result:** CONSISTENT - No race conditions detected
- Parallel quotes return consistent prices
- State modifications handled correctly

### 5. Information Leakage
- **Result:** SECURE - No sensitive data in error messages
- No stack traces or internal paths exposed
- Clean error responses

## Test Coverage Summary

| Category | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Critical |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Input Validation | 10 | 9 | 1 | 0 |
| Rate Limiting | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 |
| Token Security | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| MEV Protection | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| Concurrency | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| DoS Patterns | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |

## Recommendations Priority List

### 1. IMMEDIATE (Within 24 hours)
- Implement rate limiting middleware
- Add circuit breakers for cascade failure prevention
- Set up monitoring alerts for suspicious patterns

### 2. HIGH (Within 1 week)
- Add request signing to prevent replay attacks
- Implement CORS properly for API endpoints
- Add request size limits (payload max: 1MB)
- Implement gradual degradation under load

### 3. MEDIUM (Within 1 month)
- Add honeypot endpoints to detect attackers
- Implement shadow banning for abusive addresses
- Add ML-based anomaly detection
- Create incident response playbook

## Suggested Monitoring Alerts

**High Request Rate**
- Condition: requests_per_minute > 1000
- Action: auto_throttle

**Large Trade Attempt**
- Condition: trade_size > pool_liquidity * 0.1
- Action: flag_for_review

**Repeated Failed Attempts**
- Condition: failed_requests > 50 in 5m
- Action: temporary_ban

**Unusual Token Pairs**
- Condition: unknown_token_attempted
- Action: log_and_monitor

## Security Best Practices Checklist

### For the Development Team:
- Implement rate limiting (CRITICAL)
- Add request signing/authentication
- Set up WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Implement circuit breakers
- Add comprehensive logging
- Set up real-time monitoring
- Create incident response plan
- Regular security audits
- Implement gradual rollout for updates
- Add chaos engineering tests

### For the Operations Team:
- Monitor for unusual spikes in traffic
- Set up automated alerts for anomalies
- Regular review of access logs
- Implement IP-based geographic restrictions if needed
- Set up DDoS protection (Cloudflare/AWS Shield)
- Regular backup of critical data
- Disaster recovery plan
- Regular security training

## Testing Tools Developed

Two security testing tools have been created:
1. security-tester.js - Basic vulnerability scanner
2. attack-simulator.js - Advanced attack pattern simulator

These can be run periodically to ensure ongoing security.

## Conclusion

GalaSwap demonstrates strong security fundamentals with good protection against common Web3 attacks. The critical issue of missing rate limiting should be addressed immediately. The DEX appears resistant to MEV attacks, which is excellent for user protection.

**Overall Security Score: 7/10**
- Loses 3 points for missing rate limiting (critical)
- Strong in all other tested areas

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Implement rate limiting
2. **Week 1:** Deploy monitoring and alerts
3. **Month 1:** Complete security hardening checklist
4. **Ongoing:** Regular security testing using provided tools
