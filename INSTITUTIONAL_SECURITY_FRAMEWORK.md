## Security Metrics Dashboard

### Institutional Confidence Score (ICS)
```javascript
calculateICS() {
    const weights = {
        critical: 100,  // Any critical = 0 score
        high: 25,       // Each high = -25 points
        medium: 5,      // Each medium = -5 points
        low: 1          // Each low = -1 point
    };
    
    // Start at 100, deduct for vulnerabilities
    let score = 100;
    
    // Critical issues = immediate zero
    if (criticalCount > 0) return 0;
    
    score -= (highCount * weights.high);
    score -= (mediumCount * weights.medium);
    score -= (lowCount * weights.low);
    
    // Add confidence from test coverage
    score = score * (testsPassed / totalTests);
    
    return Math.max(0, Math.round(score));
}
```

### Security Assurance Levels

| ICS Score | Rating | Institutional Readiness |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------|
| 95-100 | AAA | **Institutional-Grade** - Ready for high net worth |
| 90-94 | AA | Production-Ready - Minor improvements needed |
| 80-89 | A | Secure - Address high priority items |
| 70-79 | BBB | Acceptable - Significant work required |
| 60-69 | BB | At Risk - Major vulnerabilities present |
| 0-59 | C | Unsafe - Not suitable for production |
