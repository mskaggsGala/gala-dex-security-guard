# Gala DEX Security Guard

An institutional-grade security monitoring and testing framework for GalaSwap DEX on Hyperledger Fabric, featuring 10-phase vulnerability testing covering 200+ attack vectors, real-time monitoring, and automated security assessments.

## 🛡️ Security Monitoring Features

### Ten-Phase Security Testing Framework
- **Phase 1: Infrastructure** - Rate limiting, liquidity drain protection, precision handling
- **Phase 2: Economic Security** - MEV vulnerability testing, cross-pool arbitrage detection, flash loan attack simulation
- **Phase 3: Chaincode Security** - Smart contract vulnerabilities, access control validation
- **Phase 4A: Time-based Attacks** - Deadline manipulation, race conditions, timestamp vulnerabilities  
- **Phase 4B: Extended Attack Surface** - Bridge security, pool creation validation, advanced endpoint testing
- **Phase 4C: Performance & Load** - Rate limit detection, concurrent load handling, performance degradation
- **Phase 5: Permissioned Network** - MSP security, identity management, certificate validation
- **Phase 6: Consensus & Ordering** - Byzantine fault tolerance, consensus manipulation attempts
- **Phase 7: Privacy & Confidentiality** - ZKP validation, private data isolation, channel security
- **Phase 8: Compliance & Regulatory** - AML/KYC checks, transaction monitoring, regulatory compliance
- **Phase 9: Business Logic Exploits** - Arbitrage detection, oracle manipulation, MEV protection
- **Phase 10: Zero-Day & APT** - Supply chain security, quantum readiness, advanced persistent threats

### Enhanced Security Dashboard (NEW!)
- **Interactive Dashboard** at http://localhost:3001 with clickable issue cards
- **Detailed Remediation Guidance** - Click any issue to see:
  - How the test was run (methodology and code)
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Step-by-step fix instructions with code examples
  - Testing checklists for verification
- **Smart Issue Display** - Automatically formats complex test results
- **Test Phase Status** - Visual overview of security state per phase
- **Developer-Friendly** - Everything needed to understand and fix issues

### Automated Scheduling
- Critical tests every 5 minutes
- Infrastructure tests hourly
- Economic security tests every 6 hours
- Extended surface tests every 12 hours
- Performance tests daily at 2 AM
- Automated report generation daily at 9 AM

## 🚨 Current Security Findings

| Severity | Issue | Impact | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| CRITICAL | No API Rate Limiting | 300+ requests/second allowed | OPEN |
| HIGH | Pool Creation Without Auth | Unauthorized pool creation possible | OPEN |

node src/dashboard.js
# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

#### Run Individual Test Phases
```bash
# Phase 1: Infrastructure
node -e "const m = new (require('./src/security-monitor'))(); m.runBasicTests()"

# Phase 2: Economic Security
node -e "const m = new (require('./src/security-monitor'))(); m.runPhase2Tests()"

# Phase 4B: Extended Surface
node -e "const m = new (require('./src/security-monitor'))(); m.runPhase4BTests()"

# Phase 4C: Performance
node -e "const m = new (require('./src/security-monitor'))(); m.runPhase4CTests()"
```

### Trading Bot Features

#### Pool Discovery
```bash
npm run discover          # Find active trading pools
npm run discover-verbose  # Detailed pool information
```

#### Arbitrage Detection
```bash
npm run arbitrage  # Monitor for profitable opportunities
```

#### Automated Trading
```bash
npm run trade  # Start trading bot (simulation mode by default)
```

## Monitoring Schedule

| Test Suite | Frequency | Coverage |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Critical Tests | 5 minutes | Rate limiting |
| Phase 1 | Hourly | Infrastructure security |
| Phase 2 | 6 hours | Economic attack vectors |
| Phase 4B | 12 hours | Extended attack surface |
| Phase 4C | Daily 2 AM | Performance & load testing |
| Reports | Daily 9 AM | Comprehensive security report |

## Test Results Format

Test results are saved in `security-results/` with naming convention:
- `security-[timestamp].json` - General test results
- `security-Phase-[X]-[timestamp].json` - Phase-specific results
- `latest-Phase-[X].json` - Most recent results for each phase

## Safety Features

- **Dry Run Mode**: Test strategies without real transactions
- **Rate Limit Detection**: Identifies missing API throttling
- **Slippage Protection**: Maximum acceptable price deviation
- **Position Limits**: Maximum percentage of wallet per trade
- **Automated Alerts**: Critical issues logged to `security-alerts.log`

## Development

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test module in `src/`
2. Add to appropriate phase in `security-monitor.js`
3. Update scheduler if needed
4. Test with `test-all-phases.js`

### Dashboard Customization

#### Enhanced Dashboard (src/enhanced-dashboard.js)
- Interactive issue cards with click-to-expand details
- Remediation guidance in `src/remediation-guide.js`
- Smart formatting for complex test results
- Fallback content for tests without specific guidance

#### Original Dashboard (src/dashboard.js)
- Simple status display
- Alert thresholds
- Refresh intervals
- Test categorization

### Adding Remediation Guidance
1. Edit `src/remediation-guide.js`
2. Add entry with test name as key
3. Include:
   - Description and impact
   - How test was run (method, code)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Immediate remediation steps
   - Implementation examples
   - Testing checklist

## Risk Warning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
- This system identifies security vulnerabilities in the GalaSwap DEX
- Trading features carry significant financial risk
- Always start with simulation mode
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose
- Keep private keys secure and never commit them to git

## Current Status

✅ All systems operational
- 4 test phases running
- Dashboard active
- Scheduler configured
- 80% tests passing
- 1 critical issue identified

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check test results in `security-results/`
- View alerts in `security-alerts.log`
- Monitor dashboard at http://localhost:3000
- Review console output for detailed diagnostics
